Jenkins is a java based application.   
So first we need to install java on ubuntu machine. run following commands to install java.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```
Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
